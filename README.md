# VidTool

VidTool is a video processing tool with both a modern graphical user interface (GUI) and a command line interface (CLI). It relies on ffmpeg and ffprobe, making it easy to batch process video files, reencode, gather information, and perform common video management tasks.

## Features (GUI)

The GUI version (`app.py`) provides an intuitive interface for managing and processing video files. Key features include:

### Core Features
- Browse and select directories containing video files
- View detailed information about each video (resolution, codecs, streams, etc.)
- Batch select and process multiple videos
- Reencode videos with customizable options (codec, suffix, extension, CRF, etc.)
- Play videos directly from the interface

### Enhanced Video Management (New!)
- **Column Sorting**: Click any column header to sort videos by filename, codec, resolution, or size
- **Live Filtering**: Real-time filtering with regex support - find videos instantly as you type
- **Batch Operations**: 
  - Rename multiple videos using regex patterns with preview
  - Move selected videos to organized subfolders
  - Advanced pattern matching with capture groups

### Workflow Example
1. **Filter**: Type "2023" to find all 2023 content, or use regex like `S\d+E\d+` for TV episodes
2. **Sort**: Click column headers to organize by size, codec, resolution, etc.
3. **Select**: Use the smart "Select All" checkbox to quickly select/deselect all visible videos
4. **Batch Process**: Rename with patterns like `(.*)_(\d{4})_(.*)` â†’ `\2_\1_\3` to move year to front

The GUI is built with wxPython. To use it, ensure you have `wxPython` installed:

```
pip install wxPython
```

Then run:

```bash
python app.py
```

## Demo & Testing

To explore the new features with sample data, run the comprehensive demo:

```bash
python demo_all_features.py
```

This demo creates 23 diverse temporary video files and showcases:
- Live filtering with regex examples
- Column sorting across all data types  
- Batch rename operations with real files
- Moving files to organized subfolders

The demo includes quick filter buttons and guided examples to help you understand the full capabilities.

## Command Line Tool

VidTool also includes a command line tool (`vidtool.py`) for advanced users and scripting. The CLI supports batch reencoding, renaming, and information extraction.

```
usage: vidtool [-h] {reencode,rename,info} ...

Tool for batch reencoding, getting video info, and renaming videos with resolution.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

subcommands:
  {reencode,rename,info}
    reencode            Reencode a file/files with the extension specified, appending a suffix to the filename.
    rename              Rename a file (or all files in the current directory) to include video resolution.
    info                Get information about a video file.
```

See below for full CLI usage and options.

## Installation

VidTool does not require installation. Just make sure you have `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` installed and available in your system path. For the GUI, you will also need `wxPython` (see above).

To install all required Python dependencies, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
usage: vidtool reencode [-h] [--av-copy-only] [--x265] [--vcodec [VCODEC]] [--acodec [ACODEC]] [--strip-video] [--strip-audio] [--strip-subs] [--strip-data]
                        [--custom-flags [CUSTOM_FLAGS ...]] [--batch] [--fix-resolution] [--fix-errors] [--force | --no-clobber]
                        pattern ext suffix

positional arguments:
  pattern               Pattern to match input files. "*.avi" for example.
  ext                   File extension to use for output files. Determines the codec used.
  suffix                Suffix to add after the file name and before the extension.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --av-copy-only        Copy audio and video streams only, strip everything else, and make an exact copy.
  --x265                Force using x265, and set crf to 28.
  --vcodec [VCODEC]     Specify a video codec (or use copy to copy rather than reencode video).
  --acodec [ACODEC]     Specify a audio codec (or use copy to copy rather than reencode audio).
  --strip-video         Strip video streams.
  --strip-audio         Strip audio streams.
  --strip-subs          Strip subtitle streams.
  --strip-data          Strip data streams.
  --custom-flags [CUSTOM_FLAGS ...]
                        Custom flags to use with ffmpeg, enclosed in quotes.
  --batch               Batch reencode all files in a directory matching a pattern, such as "*.avi".
  --fix-resolution      Odd numbered resolution fix. Scale to nearest even resolution.
  --fix-errors          Attempt to fix errors. Same as --err_detect ignore_err in ffmpeg.
  --force               Force overwriting existing files.
  --no-clobber          Don't overwriting existing files.

usage: vidtool info [-h] [--json] file

positional arguments:
  file        Video file to get information about.

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --json      Output information in JSON format.

usage: vidtool rename [-h] [--batch] [file]

positional arguments:
  file        Filename. Required if not using --batch.

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --batch     Batch rename all files in a directory.
```
